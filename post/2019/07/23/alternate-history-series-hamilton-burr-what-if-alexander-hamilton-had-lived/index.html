			<pre><code>Alexander Hamilton, the first Secretary of Treasury, a hero &amp; scholar, war-hero, and Founding Father of the United States of America, was one of the most important and influential men in American history while being one of the youngest.
</code></pre>

<p>Alexander died on July 24, 1804, aged 47 years old, pouring gushing blood on the soil of the country he fought for and built out of dust. Standing ten feet away from his cold, blue corpse stood his one time best friend, Vice President Aaron Burr, holding a piped smoking continental dueling pistol. The two men were once the greatest of friends, now enemies with pistols pointed at one another’s skull. However, the path they were on would likely have concluded with their eventual armistice and peace with one another, were we to see the end of it.</p>

<p>It’s no secret as to how or why Burr shot Hamilton. It’s just such a tragedy that such a young hero as Alexander Hamilton had to die so young. If only we could’ve saved him, it would’ve done so much good for our young nation.</p>

<p>Our discussion lays is in the question: “What if?” What if Hamilton had survived? What happens to Burr and Hamilton? Do we get a treaty? A white flag? A cease-fire? Anything?</p>

<p>Let us travel back in time! Back to the past!: We travel to July 24, 1804, the death day of Alexander Hamilton, at 5:00 am, in Weehawken, New Jersey.</p>

<p>Ok, so first, we become Alexander Hamilton’s second for his duel instead of Nathaniel Pendelton, so that we can ease tensions prevent Hamilton from dying. Once we forced Burr to miss his shot, the duel is likely called off by himself as he did in most of his previous duels. Instead, both Burr and Hamilton agree on terms, ending further animosities. The two shake hands and leave Weehawken New Jersey with their lives and dignity. Hamilton is saved!</p>

<p>Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr return home to their homes in New York City, not on speaking terms. They greet their wives, kiss their children, and continue their work. There is no scandal, no division, no headlines: “Vice-President Burr kills Hamilton in COLD BLOOD!”, and no party divisions or choosing sides.</p>

<p>After the dust settles between the duel, it’s mid-August of 1804. Burr, the current Vice-President, was planning to take another shot at the race of President, given that he was so close to winning last time! The race begins, Burr and Jefferson head-to-head once again. Burr runs with the Whig Party, and Jefferson with the Democratic-Republicans, beginning the Presidental Election of 1804.</p>

<p>In the Election of 1804, Burr and Jefferson mostly combat each other, while the Federalist candidate, Charles C. Pinkeny tries to gain support in the north. While Alexander Hamilton, living in the North, does support the Federalist Party and hates Jefferson &amp; Burr, he is mostly silent during this race. As Hamilton is the face of the Federalist Party, his silence causes the Party to lose votes.</p>

<p>The race, once again, is solely between returnee, Thomas Jefferson, and former Vice-President, Aaron Burr.</p>

<p>By November 1804, the results are in! The winner of the Election of 1804 is Thomas Jefferson. There was no surprise in his victory, the surprise lays in the margin of the votes which Burr receives. Burr received about 37% of the votes, while Jefferson barely received over 53%.</p>

<p>Burr, having received so many votes in the presidential election, gains support and relevance for the Whig Party.</p>

<p>While all of the presidential elections and what not were happening, our friend Alexander Hamilton has slowed things down. Hamilton has spent the past couple of months with his family and friends.</p>

<p>However, after all the smoke had settled, Hamilton was the first to go on the offensive against the growing Whig Party. Hamilton was still his divisive self, attacking Burr and his political or moral views. However, Burr, a changed man, does not act rashly. Instead, Burr shuts out Hamilton and continues his campaign across the country to gain support for his presidential campaign which isn’t for another three or four years.</p>

<p>Through all of the campaigning and mudslinging, no further animosities form between Burr and Hamilton. Their prevalence continues to grow for both of them as the years go by.</p>

<p>However, in 1808, with the new term on the horizon, the official campaigning begins. The parties select their frontrunners. The Democratic-Republican candidate: James Madison; the Whig frontrunner: Aaron Burr; and the Federalist leader: Alexander Hamilton.</p>

<p>The election is much of the same as the previous year. However, in the end, James Madison wins the election. Despite the disappoint in Alexander Hamilton, James Madison chooses an interesting cabinet:</p>

<p>President: James Madison</p>

<p>Vice President: Thomas Jefferson</p>

<p>Secretary of State: Henry Clay.</p>

<p>Chief of Staff: George Clinton</p>

<p>Secretary of Treasury: Alexander Hamilton</p>

<p>Alexander and James had worked closely years before, drafting the U.S. Constitution and Federalist Papers, and they took every opportunity the could to work side-by-side.</p>

<p>Hamilton does is casual stuff, being incredible and everything. Hamilton continues to improve the United States, implementing a system of an Independent Treasury of the United States. This helps bring the United States to economic prosperity during their period of war during the War of 1812.</p>

<p>In 1812, Madison wins reelection, continuing Hamilton’s reign.</p>

<p>As the years go on, everything that happened in our history happened in theirs. Except, this time, Burr is still of great prevalence.</p>

<p>Later on, in 1816, the next presidential election begins. The candidates appear in the Whig Party &amp; Democratic-Republican Party, as the Federalists don’t have much traction. The candidates: Aaron Burr and Henry Clay.</p>

<p>In the election of 1816, Burr, a revolutionary campaigner, and an ultimately charming man, sees one of his largest surge in popularity, winning the vote, 128-89.</p>

<p>The President of the United States is chosen. The Fifth President, Aaron Burr. His cabinet:</p>

<p>President: Aaron Burr</p>

<p>Vice-President: George Clinton</p>

<p>Secretary of State: Dewitt Clinton</p>

<p>Secretary of Treasury: Albert Gallatin</p>

<p>Chief Justice: John Marshall</p>

<p>Chief of Staff: Rufus King</p>

<p>Burr’s campaign was based largely upon the inclusion of civil liberties and rights, and so was his term. Burr advocates for women’s and black’s rights, expanding the publicization of a moderate civil rights movement. However prominent Burr is, he gains many enemies to the south, advocating for equal representation. Also, it comes back to bite him…</p>

<p>In the presidential election of 1820, Aaron Burr runs for reelection. However, against him, Alexander Hamilton runs for president. As Burr lost much support in his presidency, he does not have many votes.</p>

<p>Alexander Hamilton, his once best friend, his once enemy, and now his acquaintance, beats him for office. Hamilton selects his cabinet:</p>

<p>President: Alexander Hamilton</p>

<p>Vice-President: John Quincy Adams</p>

<p>Secretary of Treasury: George W. Campbell</p>

<p>Secretary of State: James Monroe</p>

<p>Alexander Hamilton becomes the 16th President of the United States in 1820. Former president, Aaron Burr dies shortly after in 1823, aged 67, dying likely from his deteriorating health and diseases in his family tree.</p>

<p>Hamilton, the President of the United States, goes on to serve his term. The rest? As they say, is alternate history. You decide the rest! You decide what happens. What do you think? Do you think Hamilton is a good president? Does he become everything that he’s shown to be?</p>
