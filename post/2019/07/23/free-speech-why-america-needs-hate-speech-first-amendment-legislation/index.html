			<p>Within recent events, whether it be the bomb threats on Democratic Candidates, the Congressmen massacre, or the “Trump Whistle Blowing” events, society has blamed public speakers and their perceived message of “whistling for” or “inciting” violence for these horrific events of inhumanity.</p>

<p>Both Republicans and Democrats have been quick to blame the opposite side for “inciting” violence or “whistling” for it. In 2017, former presidential candidate, Bernie Sanders, at a rally for public assembly, he exclaimed how a healthcare bill which was just passed by Congress was going to “kill millions of people!” Later, at the holding of the Congressional Charity Baseball Game, an armed gunner arrived at the stadium, shooting up the place, wounding several innocents, and killing Congressman Steve Scalise. The shooter, who shall remain unnamed, claims to have been inspired by Sanders’ message. Many Republicans blamed Sanders. Another time, in 2019, headlines roared, saying, “Trump is inciting violence, and now we have a MAGA bomber” (Truscott IV, Salon.com). The event in early 2019 was an incredibly close call, in which luckily nobody was killed. However, inspired by President Trump’s disliking towards a few of the Democratic figures, a deranged man who shall remain unnamed, placed bombs in the vicinity of several of the Democrats such as Hilary and Bill Clinton, Joe Biden, Barrack Obama, and more, in hopes of killing them. The suspect claimed to have been inspired by and doing it for President Trump. Many in the Democratic Party blamed President Trump. However, These men were deranged and insane. The involved parties, Senator Sanders and President Trump, had no involvement or liabilities in this disgusting exhibit of inhumanity. The only men at fault are those involved.</p>

<p>Regardless of this, whether or not these people are involved in these “calls for violence”, they might have inspired them. After all, Nazism, Stalinism, and Maoism, the largest and most destructive political movements all were created in an inspiration of a speaker. Shut down the inspirer, stop the inspiration, right? Wrong.</p>

<p>TRYING TO SHUT DOWN HATE SPEECH AMPLIFIES IT.
Both in Nazi Germany and Stalinist Russia, Adolf Hitler &amp; Joseph Stalin were imprisoned for their hateful rhetoric. Germany, during the time, had incredibly restrictive laws on freedom of speech, so they took down Hitler. However, despite their intentions, this only made things worse. Hitler was viewed as a martyr, a saint, whose beliefs were that of a prophet as they were trying to be silenced. Eventually, Hitler became a celebrity even while serving in jail, being reported on, having his views amplified, and having his dangerous follwing grow.</p>

<p>Today, at various college campuses, it’s uncommon to see a group of protesters outside an auditorium if a speaker like Ben Shapiro or Milo Yiannopoulos is scheduled to be speaking. Often the protesters will come in the auditorium, screaming &amp; shouting and blowing airhorns, in atempt of shutting it down. Below, a Milo Yiannopoilos protest:</p>

<p>However, their protests only make their enemies grow. If we give legislation to try and stop these individuals, they will just continue to grow. They’re the reason that Milo Yiannopoilos became the larger than life political figure that we know him as today.</p>

<p>GREAT SPEECH WAS ONCE HATE SPEECH.
In the early 1960s, many common people in the United States were racist, many people were not open to ideas that challenged their traditional beliefs. However, their was a small population out there who did fight for and preach messages of racial and gender equality; One of those people was Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Dr. King was inspired to lead a charge against the hate, against the racism, so he did. Dr. King, being a part of the minority, took to the streets and to the courthouses, in which he spoke and preached about these unpopular ideas. He too was arrested, shut down, and ridiculed, only growing his scope. He was seen on the news, on the cover of magazines and newspapers. Dr. King was a public spokesman who was viewed almost identically as Hitler was at the time. They were both martyrs, prophets of their cause. Sometimes, the greatest speech is often the most hated. Ideas that start as hated are often controversial which gives them the ability to be great. Sometimes, ideas are hated for a reason. However, if we give the government, an agency with their own agendas such as we have our own, the ability to pick and choose what’s “appropriate” to be shared, we risk losing our chance at achieving new successes from various ideas.</p>

<p>OUR SOCIETY NEEDS HATE SPEECH.
Whether it’s real hate speech or not, too many speakers are being shut down by individuals because of a message that many don’t agree with. This trend is not only making echo chambers of belief, but it’s creating a society engulfed in opposition, true hatred, and isolation. Free speech, whether it’s hate speech or not, is the pinnacle of a free society and will be the preservation of our democracy.</p>
