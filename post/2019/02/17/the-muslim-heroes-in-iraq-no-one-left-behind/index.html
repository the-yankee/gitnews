<p>In 2014, during the Iraqi warring conflicts, over 20,000 people died in one year. More than 6,000 of them were civilians. Ever since the U.S. entered the conflict, the death toll has thus reached over 500,000 casualties.</p>

<p>During this conflict, the U.S. received much help from local Iraqi civilians. Many civilians offered their assistance as translators and cooperators for the United States Military. These interpreters knew the area which Marines were dealing with, offering an important knowledge to the Marines.</p>

<p>The Iraqi government and various terrorist groups declared these interpreters and civilians who cooperated with the U.S. Marines to be enemies of the state. Bounties were placed upon these civilians who were just trying to do good.</p>

<p>Many of the interpreters, as well as their families, were executed, either by ISIS or Iraqi militiamen. The U.S. Marines harbored many of them from threats, as they had willfully tried to improve their homeland, in cooperation with Marines.</p>

<p>However, when the United States pulled the military out of Iraq, the civilians’ shield disappeared. Within a number of days, thousands of Iraqi citizens and their families were slaughtered.</p>

<p>These families could not escape to neighboring countries, as ISIS controlled many exit points and cities. They were trapped.</p>

<p>A few of these stories have been painted in the future Netflix production, The Interpreters, showing the horrors and trauma that these families had to go through.</p>

<p>The only solution which appealed to these families was to immigrate to the United States, the only country which would offer them safety as well as accept them. If that would not work, the families would be forced to hide in the Middle East, in constant paranoia and fear for their lives.</p>

<p>Most of the interpreters applied for Visas to enter the United States and live there with their families.</p>

<p>One interpreter, Madtuk, living in Iraq under ISIS, applied for a SIV in 2014. He has not been accepted yet.</p>

<p>About 50,000 to 70,000 interpreters and their families have applied for SIV’s, seeking safety from the terror at their homes. These numbers rarely decrease as a result of the United States accepting them, but decreases due to ISIS killing them.
The United States will not accept these men and their families, even though they served for the U.S. Marines, fighting the same battles as them, and most importantly risking their own lives for the country.</p>

<p>These men deserve recognition for the sacrifice they’ve given. They deserve the rewards for that sacrifice. Most importantly, they deserve the right to not fear for their lives in Iraq.</p>

<p>Is the problem in Iraq fixable? Most likely not. However, we can still save some of them; those who have helped us, setting up a future of bounties on their heads as a result. These families need our help.</p>

<p>Reform is needed. It’s needed for those who have no escape from the devil on their back. The only solution is to help these families by bringing them here, their true home.</p>

<p>These men have been waiting, some for over 5 years. It seems, however sad, that their time is running out. They need to get here, but the United States won&rsquo;t bring them home.</p>

<p>A non-profit organization has been trying to bring these men home to safety. The organization, No One Left Behind has been seeking the safety of these people. Their page is available at the top of the article.</p>

<p>The stories of these national heroes will be shown in the upcoming film, The Interpreters.</p>

<p>To help, donate to these organizations. Soon, we can recognize these heroes and bring them to safety.</p>
