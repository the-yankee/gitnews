			<p>President Donald Trump has shown the United States his determination in getting his way in American politics. The government shutdown from late December 2018 to present has affected the United States beyond extent.</p>

<p>The federal shutdown, an executive order, drafted by President Trump, in response to the democratic majority of the Senate disapproving of “The Wall.</p>

<p>So, this shutdown; is it justified? Is Trump right? Or is Trump the devil in disguise, as he ruins our sweet nation?</p>

<p>Well, it is quite unfair for us to judge the effects and defects of Trump’s governmental shutdown when it is a new event and hasn’t been analyzed over the long term. However, we can look at this shutdown and compare it to past events, as well as predict the future effects.</p>

<p>How many federal shutdowns have there been in the United States? There have been about 12-16 federal shutdowns since 1976, so this isn’t anything new or anything for us to be worried about. However, most of these shutdowns lasted from about 1-5 days. The longest lasting shutdown was during the Clinton Administration, lasting a total of 21 days. President Trump’s shutdown has already been active for about 3 weeks or 22 days.</p>

<p>However, there have been past governmental shutdown that was not approved by the legislature.</p>

<p>The most notable example of this is the government shutdown of 1929.</p>

<p>During the federal shutdown of 1929, President Herbert Hoover saw the stock market crash known as Black Sunday. In response to Black Sunday, President Hoover bombarded the public with a series of tariffs and taxes on common goods, including alcohol. This didn’t help as unemployment completely skyrocketed. President Hoover had no idea what to do, so he shut down the federal government for about 2 months.</p>

<p>President Hoover shut down the government to try and give the people room to breathe, in light of all the taxes being placed. However, the shutdown just made things worse as there was much repair that the government needed to help in aiding, in regards to Black Sunday.</p>

<p>Now, in regards to Trump’s government shutdown; we should not panic, as we were not in a state of desperation when it began.</p>

<p>However, we are not quite out of the woods yet…</p>

<p>President Trump’s federal shutdown has cut off a series of federal taxation but has not cut the federal reserve’s spending budget.</p>

<p>Since the budget has not been cut there will be a larger amount of funds needed to fund those programs which failed to make money during the shutdown. How are they going to get that money? Yep, you guessed it. Taxes.</p>

<p>The Legislative body will likely take action to help collect the money, not collected, during the federal shutdown. However, the Tax Cuts &amp; Jobs Act does not allow any taxes to be collected to help raise funds for a government budget. Due to this, we will have to cut the fat out of the government budget, increasing the legroom, allowing the government to sustain itself.</p>

<p>The government shutdown is a divisive topic and will likely have a long term effect on the future of the United States of America and all of the citizens living with the consequences of our federal government.</p>
