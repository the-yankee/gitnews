			<p>With the recent passing of President’s Day, the office of the presidency is reminisced upon. The office has been held 45 different times by 44 different men. These men have served our country and changed it in several different ways, big and small, which is why we honor them, this presidents day.</p>

<p>Presidents like Abraham Lincoln, George Washington, and John F. Kennedy are often regarded as the U.S. However, it’s very unlikely that when discussing the greatest presidents in America you bring up Grover Cleaveland.</p>

<p>Grover Cleaveland, the 22nd President of the United States was also the 24th. He was the only president to serve two non-consecutive terms.</p>

<p>Cleaveland’s legacy is often credited with being the only non-consecutively serving president, but this an insult to his accomplishments, as he impacted the country in such a huge manner.</p>

<p>In 1885, Governor Grover Cleaveland is elected president because of his promising political beliefs, his honor &amp; valor, and his open-mindedness which is what America needed after the Civil War.</p>

<p>Grover Cleaveland was the first democratic president elected after the Civil War. Since the Civil War, little had been done to improve to political &amp; social infrastructure which was damaged during the Civil War.</p>

<p>Except for James Garfield &amp; Ulysses S. Grant, few presidents eased these tensions. Cleaveland, a Democrat, was oddly propelled by the beliefs of the founding fathers &amp; the constitution.</p>

<p>Tensions between southern Democrats &amp; northern Republicans were peaked since the fall of the Confederacy. Grover Cleaveland knew that he was coming into a dangerous political sphere where he would be heavily criticized by both sides, no matter what.</p>

<p>For perspective, Cleaveland was coming into an environment which was similar to what Barrack Obama entered, in 2008.</p>

<p>Cleaveland became determined to appeal to the greater nature of America, no matter if it dirtied his public image.</p>

<p>Grover Cleaveland appointed a team of politically diverse representatives, African American staff members, and thought leaders to improve the knowledge of American citizens and himself.</p>

<p>People, in 1885, were polarized and villainized anyone on the other side politically.</p>

<p>As well, the American deficit was higher than ever, after the American Civil War created long-lasting effects, which had not been solved by the high tariffs and taxes enacted by previous presidents.</p>

<p>Cleaveland knew that the easy solution was to raise taxes &amp; tariffs and decrease the federal budget.</p>

<p>However, Cleaveland, an unconventional man, did not resort to tariffs. He reestablished an independent American treasury system, similar to the one James K. Polk’s. This retained funds for the government, separate to that of the national bank &amp; financial systems. This system decreased the national debt tremendously, solving America’s significant financial problem.</p>

<p>Now, Cleaveland had a problem with the social infrastructure of the people. This problem was significantly harder to solve and Cleaveland knew it.</p>

<p>Cleaveland was a democrat, but he appointed several Republicans to give a voice to the other side. He saw the lack of diversity in thought as the true root of the social problem in America. Cleaveland’s staff was made up of the most politically diverse crew ever, even having some former Whigs working with him. Political disputes were solved through a system of voting between Cleaveland and his staff when executive orders were considered. These problems of social tensions were not completely solved but eased. They were eased by Cleaveland’s intention to improve public knowledge, ease political tensions, and inspire diversity.</p>

<p>These beliefs not only improved American society but changed them forever. Before then, politics was always a topic of divisiveness &amp; disagreement. Cleaveland appealed to not a single side of America but improved all people in every political side.</p>

<p>However beneficial to America, Cleaveland’s impact angered many, as neither full political agenda was being fulfilled. This disappointment, eventually, cost Cleaveland his second term, when he lost, in 1889 to Benjamin Harrison.</p>

<p>Harrison somewhat sleazed off of the accomplishments of Cleaveland.</p>

<p>Grover Cleaveland went on to serve another term in 1893. Cleaveland continued to build his legacy of divisiveness &amp; truth.</p>

<p>Nowadays, Grover Cleaveland is remembered mostly for his two separate terms. However, this is an insult to all of his accomplishments. He changed the country forever and should be remembered forever.</p>
