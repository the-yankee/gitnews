			<p>President Donald J. Trump is a divisive president, to say the least. He is often described as ‘unfit’ to be President of the United States. Whether this statement is true or not, are his policies constitutional?</p>

<p>His policies have inspired controversy upon both sides of the political spectrum, but should his executive orders hold up in the supreme court?</p>

<p>First, let’s look at the behemoth of the Trump Administration: ‘The Wall’. Is it constitutional? It depends.</p>

<p>We all know of Trump’s plan to build a wall on the south Mexican-American border to limit the spread of illegal immigration.
Depends on the political sovereignty agreements which we possess in relation with Mexico. Given that the Mexican government has given extensive political control over the Mexican-American border, it is within’ the United States’ political grasp to apply aid to the border.
    However, if individual states were to claim control over their border between their state and it’s border between Mexico, then the Fifth Amendment’s takings clause denies the federal government ownership over that part of the border. The executive order would not go to the legislative body to overturn the hindrance; it would be denied altogether.</p>

<p>As of now, however, Trump’s determination with ‘The Wall’ is within’ line with all constitutional laws. Now let’s look at Trump’s limitation on the transgender being able to serve in the military.
    The executive order denies the transgender community to aid the country in the service to the military. How’s it hold up in the supreme court?
    Due to the Fourteenth Amendment in the U.S. Constitution, as well as the Equal Protection Clause could possibly grant this proposition unconstitutional. The Equal Protection Clause declares a law or an act which denies a group of people their civil liberties which the constitution grants them, based on the race, ethnicity, or other personal qualities, therefore unconstitutional. When put to the test in a trial, three different courts declared the law unconstitutional.</p>

<p>However, the Executive action was not overturned in the Supreme Court. Why is this?</p>

<p>The case which was brought to The Supreme Court was that which argued to stop the limitation of the transgender community in the military. Did you catch that? The limitation of the transgender community in the military.
 Despite mainstream beliefs, President Trump’s executive order does not deny service to all members of the transgender community, but it gives commanding officers the right to deny people of the transgender community from entering their command. While this may not line up with all of our morals, it is, therefore, constitutional as it does not deny any civil liberties to the transgender community.
As well, this holds up with Public Law 88-352 passed by Congress, in 1964, when the Civil Rights Act came into effect. This states, publics administrations like movie theaters, public pools, restaurants, businesses, as well as military &amp; police stations, can deny service to someone, given that it is not for a reason of race, religion, ethnicity, sex, nationality, or any other characteristic which the person cannot prevent.
    Therefore, Trump’s executive order is, for now, in line with all constitutional grounds.</p>

<p>Lastly, looking at President Trump’s administration as a whole, to see if he’s gotten out of line will the law or violated natural order in the constitutional; we will see if President Trump has been in line with the document of our nation.</p>

<p>President Trump’s administration is, debatably, one of the most divisive executive powers in the United States history.
    Much of what we hear from the people in the United States is that Trump has engaged in a Russian collusion, that Trump is racist, Trump is anti-muslim, and a rapist.</p>

<p>However, we at the Unionist are not to decide whether President Trump is all of those things. But, we can look at the facts; we see that, despite President Trump’s accusations and lawsuits. Maryland v Trump, CREW v. Trump, and more show us that Trump’s actions have not led to any prosecutions or removal from office for unconstitutional actions.
    However, in an impending case, Hawaii v. Trump, it will test Trump’s constitutional alignment.
    In Hawaii v. Trump, Hawaii is accusing President Trump of committing an unconstitutional action, restricting Muslims entry to the country, in his ‘Muslim Ban’. 2 weeks ago, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case, so the country will see the outcome.</p>

<p>The case will likely determine the liability of President Trump and his interaction with the U.S. Constitution and the country as a whole.</p>
