			<p>President Donald J. Trump, the 45th President of the United States has vocally preached of a border wall to stop the illegal trafficking through the Mexican-American border. Trump has received a lot of backlash for this belief. However, recent events in California have drawn many to Trump’s side.</p>

<p>Early Wednesday morning, an illegal Mexican immigrant (NAME WITHHELD) murdered a Newman County Corporal, Ronil Singh after he was pulled over for drunk driving. The suspect then evacuated the murder scene, as Corporal Singh bled out, being later pronounced dead.</p>

<p>After these events unfolded, President Trump tweeted: “There is right now a full scale manhunt going on in California for an illegal immigrant accused of shooting and killing a police officer during a traffic stop. Time to get tough on Border Security. Build the Wall!”</p>

<p>Corporal Ronil Singh had a family. He had a wife, who loved him dearly. He also had two children of young age. They will never see Ronil again. Two children lost their father and a woman lost her love; along with several others, who lost a friend, a partner, and a good man of their community. Whether any of us are Democrats or Republicans, we can agree that the death of a man, who has sworn his life to protect fellow citizens from harm, is a true tragedy. Regardless of our views on police officers, Corporal Singh was a good man who did not deserve the tragic fate which he received.</p>

<p>But, would a wall across the Mexican border have saved beloved police officer, a father, loving husband, and friend, Corporal Singh?</p>

<p>The suspect has since been apprehended and arrested. The suspect is confirmed to be an illegal immigrant, who crossed the Mexican border illegally. Sheriff, Donny Youngblood, of Neman County, who arrested the suspect says, that the suspect was attempting to get his friend across the border and he would do anything to achieve his goal, which led to the shooting.</p>

<p>Trump’s border wall is said to be spread across the entire Mexican border, blocking access to the Rio Grande and critical points for illegal immigrant’s descent into the American mainland. The wall would most likely work to an extent. According to CNN, the border wall would stop an estimated 15-25% of illegal immigrants from entering the country. The wall would be incredibly high, that ladders would be insufficient.</p>

<p>However, there are several tunnel systems, which various drug cartels and caravans use to enter the United States. Military support and border control would need to get those shut down to make the wall useful.</p>

<p>The wall is stopping a large number of people from entering the country across the border, forcing them to find a new way into the country.</p>

<p>However productive this wall can be, it does not stop the incredible amount of illegal aliens, entering the country by sea and air. According to Jorge Ramos, about 40 to 50 percent of all Illegal immigrants enter the country via airplanes.</p>

<p>By building a border wall, we are stopping large numbers of people from entering the country but ignoring the thousands of people, entering by airplanes, as it will be their only way to enter the country.</p>

<p>However, it’s still a large number of people who are entering the country through the border. We’re stopping more than half of illegal aliens from entering. As well, the goal of this wall is to hinder drug trafficking, which we would be doing as much of drug trafficking enters through the southern border.</p>

<p>A wall is a productive way of keeping people out of our country, but it is not the most productive. As well, according to NBC, the wall will cost an estimated $6-85 billion. So if given this colossal budget to stop illegal immigration, a more productive measure to do this should be taken.</p>

<p>But back to the question: Would the wall have stopped Corporal Ronil Singh from being killed?</p>

<p>Yes. Had the border wall had been built, Corporal Ronil Singh would likely have never been shot. Given that the suspect was attempting to cross the Mexican border by car, then he would never have been able to cross the border with his friends in the way he did.</p>

<p>However, the suspect still would be able to enter the country. The wall would just force the suspect and his friends to enter the country employing air travel.</p>

<p>The wall would’ve stopped this horrible human being from killing Corporal Singh; however, it would not stop the event as a whole, as he still could enter the country and kill someone else.</p>

<p>The wall is productive and the wall is practical. But, is the wall the best solution for our country? As we are keeping out the bad, but also the good, we don’t know if that is the correct or moral thing to do. Maybe the answer lays in: reforming our immigration system as a whole, or maybe in military support on the border, or maybe even helping Mexico get its country on track; we don’t know! We don’t know what the right answer is; In the future, the US will find out.</p>
