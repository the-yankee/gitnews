			<p>45th President, Donald Trump has preached of his achievements relating to his tax cuts and bringing jobs to the United States.</p>

<p>Yes, it is true that his tax cuts have impacted many Americans and the American job market.</p>

<p>Trump’s Tax Cut &amp; Jobs Act has decreased individual tax returns by about 4 to 7 percent. With this new tax plan enacted, the local and state governments are impacted. As mortgage &amp; interest rates that are funded by the federal government and held up by the locals, they are now required to follow the new, broad tax base set of rules.</p>

<p>But is it bad or is it good? Well, it’s a bit of both.</p>

<p>During the beginning of Trump’s term, in 2017, although many don’t like to admit it, Trump’s tax plan was promising for huge successes. The DOW Jones began a climb, after a bit of a tumble it took around the early 2010’s.</p>

<p>Did President Trump cause this climb or even have anything to do with it? We don’t know. However, we do know how President Trump responded to this American economic spike; as a result, President Trump cut individual income taxation, mortgage interest rates, and also cut federal tax revenue by about $50 billion.</p>

<p>Finally, in 2016, the IRS agreed with Congress regarding The Tax Cut &amp; Jobs Act.  They agreed that individual income tax needed to comply by reaching a minimum of $99 billion annually.</p>

<p>This was good news for us! Taxes were lower than they had been in a long time in the United States!</p>

<p>Well, we might’ve spoken too soon.</p>

<p>The DOW Jones, after its massive spike, began to fall. It plummeted. The U.S. economy really took a loss this time; as billions &amp; trillions of dollars piled up on the United States deficit.</p>

<p>But, even though the debt increased, the stock market crashed, and the economy struggled, taxes stayed low. Not only taxes stayed low; but interest rates stayed low, mortgage rates stayed low, and deductions kept appearing.</p>

<p>So, President Trump is our hero, right? He’s just looking out for us and trying to keep our taxes low.</p>

<p>We don’t know that he isn’t. But, we do know that it’s not the smartest thing to do, especially looking long term.</p>

<p>If the U.S. economy stays at this low which it’s at right now, the result won’t be pretty. The American deficit will keep growing and growing, expanding the need for federal funds, and decreasing our reliance on the U.S. Treasury.</p>

<p>With the U.S. Treasury having an unreliable perception, foreign and local investors will withdraw their funds from the banks and enterprises. Both private and federal enterprises will fail with no new investors. As a result, America would fall into a deep state of economic depression, similar to the Great Depression.</p>

<p>What’s the big deal with debt? We can just keep printing more money, right?</p>

<p>Actually, it’s not that easy. The American deficit cannot be solved by directly printing more money; as a result of this, the value of the U.S. dollar will decrease. The deficit can only be shrunk by paying off the money we owe. The hard part about that is, that it’s pretty hard to get that kind of money… 22 trillion dollars.</p>

<p>So, it is crucial that President Trump and Congress recognize that the tax cut should be applied with a grain of salt.</p>

<p>No, the tax cuts aren’t bad; however, President Trump should apply it when he can. As the American economy isn’t in a great place at the moment, it isn’t the best time to decrease federal funding &amp; taxation. However, if the economy has a spike, then the tax plan sounds great!</p>
