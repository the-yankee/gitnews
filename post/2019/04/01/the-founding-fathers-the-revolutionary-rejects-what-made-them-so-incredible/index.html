			<p>A hot summerâ€™s day, in early July, a group of criminals began the process that would be remembered from then until the day of the last man. These criminals, united by nothing but their valor and determination to create a strong foundation, began the process, known as the American Revolution.</p>

<p>These criminals were not traditional criminals, more renaissance criminals: men who were not led astray by the common, traditional beliefs which fellow men tended to cling to, only adopting practices which would change their lives for the better. More or less, these renaissance criminals saw the land of which they loved being restrained, by Great Britain, from reaching its truest and greatest potential; they made it their duty to free this land of its chains and create a land of prosperity and liberty.</p>

<p>Their names? Nobody knew of these men. Nobody knew their names. Nobody would, until their names, in big, black ink, were signed on a document of treason, The Declaration of Independence, truly defining these men as criminals, as rebels, as traitors, and soon as founders.</p>

<p>The names: George Washington, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, and John Hancock, severed in dark ink marked the beginning of a revolution, inspiring names across ages to join the fight.</p>

<p>New names appeared; some never seen before. Names like George Washington, James Madison, John Jay, Alexander Hamilton, and Aaron Burr joined the revolution to preserve liberty and truth. These men would all go on to create tremendous legacies for their names, as they took down the leashing colossus that was Great Britain, being the only ones who saw true potential in the chained nation of colonies.</p>

<p>Their names will be forever remembered. Their names became symbols of liberty and justice. Their names will eternally be focussed as founders of our country. In the upcoming Founding Fathers series, we will discuss the marks that these men made.</p>

<p>George Washington: the credited father of the United States, fought the British global superpower on the battlefield and continued to lead the nation to prosperity after the war. Washington was the highest ranking official in the United States army, using his incredible tactics of warfare to lead to the eventual British surrender at Yorktown, in 1781. Washington was a hero, being elected president in the only unanimous vote in U.S. history. His presidency saw the formation and molding of the United States and saw him leave his presidency having set many precedents which stand the test of time.</p>

<p>John Adams: the second President of the United States. John was the first vice president of the United States. He defended the British in the Boston Massacre, worked on the Declaration of Independence, and much more.</p>

<p>James Madison: the author of the Constitution and Federalist Papers. James was the 4th president of the United States and founder of the American Legislative body.</p>

<p>Thomas Jefferson: First secretary of Treasury, second Vice-President, author of the Declaration of Independence, and 3rd President of the United States.</p>

<p>John Hancock: Co-Founder of the constitutional convention, First and only sustaining President of Congress, Signer of the Declaration of Independence, and one of the first Presidents of the early U.S.</p>

<p>John Jay: Signer of the Declaration of Independence, Author of the Federalist Papers, Congressman from New York, and Founder of American Judicial System.</p>

<p>Alexander Hamilton: First Secretary of Treasury, Author of the Constitution and Federalist Papers, Founder of the American Treasury Department.</p>

<p>Aaron Burr: Senator of New York State, Founder of American progressivism, American Lt. Col., and War Hero.</p>
