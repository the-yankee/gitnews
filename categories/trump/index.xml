      <description>President Donald Trump has shown the United States his determination in getting his way in American politics. The government shutdown from late December 2018 to present has affected the United States beyond extent.
The federal shutdown, an executive order, drafted by President Trump, in response to the democratic majority of the Senate disapproving of â€œThe Wall.
