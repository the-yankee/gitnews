      <description>The United States, a nation built and based upon a system of financial and economic stability, has inherited a colossal debt of $22 trillion USD. Much of this debt has been inherited in the past century.
Since the debt rose to $1 trillion in 1981, the debt since has taken on an extra $21 trillion in under 40 years.
The United Statesâ€™ debt continues to grow today. The debt is projected to grow exponentially, another 230%, by 2050.</description>
